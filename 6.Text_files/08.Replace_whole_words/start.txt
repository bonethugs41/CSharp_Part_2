For a long time after the Olympic marathon started,
 there were no long-distance races, such as the marathon, for women.
The organisers decided start on a course of 26 miles from the start at Windsor Castle 
to the royal entrance to the White City Stadium, 
followed by a lap (586 yards, 2 feet; 536 m) of the track, finishing in front of the Royal Box.
