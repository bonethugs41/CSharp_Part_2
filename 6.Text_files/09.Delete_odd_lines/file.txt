Nikola Tesla (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) 
was a Serbian American[2][3] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,
 physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern
 alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating
 to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison. He soon struck out on his
 own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop
 a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and transformer 
were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla as a consultant to help
 develop a power system using alternating current. 
Tesla is also known for his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York
 and Colorado Springs which included patented devices and theoretical work used in the 
invention of radio communication,[5] for his X-ray experiments, and for his ill-fated
 attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.
