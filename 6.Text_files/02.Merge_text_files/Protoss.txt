The Protoss are a race of humanoids in the StarCraft series.
 They are composed of two societies, the conservative Khalai Protoss and the exiled dark templar.
 The Protoss are depicted as a physically strong species with access to advanced psionic abilities.
 The Protoss are considered the most technologically advanced race of the series and are the focus
 of two episodes within StarCraft and its expansion Brood War, as well as featuring in campaigns in the 
authorized add-ons Insurrection and Retribution.
 Protoss strategy in-game is usually built around the quality of units the player controls rather
 than the quantity. Originating from Aiur, a planet on the fringe of the galaxy, 
the Protoss are normally shown in the games and the novels of the series as the nemesis of the Zerg.
