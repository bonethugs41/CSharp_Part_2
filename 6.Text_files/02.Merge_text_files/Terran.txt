The Terrans are a fictional future version of humanity in the StarCraft series.
 The Terrans are the most splintered of the StarCraft species, consisting of multiple 
factions that not only fight the other races but each other as well.
 Considered an adaptive and mobile species, the Terrans are noted in the lore of the series for 
their ability to quickly access and drain a planet's resources.
 The Terrans have been dedicated a full campaign in each real-time strategy video game installment to date,
 and are defined in-game by their specialization of units and tactics of defense and mobility.
 In the series' storyline, the Terrans are usually displayed as being caught in-between the conflict 
between the Protoss and Zerg while also dealing with frequent civil wars.
